# Price elasticity of a burger menu

This is a README describing a big data analytics research project on price optimization. It will contain a summary of the analysis and work completed. The overall methodology is tentative and subject to change as the project progresses.

## Tentative overall methodology



## Dataset

> The dataset being used for the research project consists of a Google burger café’s transactions throughout the year. The dataset is publicly available.

## Introduction, justification and central topics

Price sensitivity is a great topic of interest in product pricing decisions. When price elasticity of certain products can be estimated accurately, optimal prices will maximize profit margins at the right level of demand. Price optimization is critical to businesses in the North American fast-food restaurant industry, an industry where profit margins are tight, and fast-food options are ubiquitous.

The application of data mining could help a restaurant chain evaluate when to prepare promotional offers during the year and for which items. 
Data mining can be used to better optimize pricing for menu items. 
Knowledge discovery will uncover patterns surrounding how certain beverages are performing and why. 
The results should aid in business decisions such as beverage menu changes, including beverage menu expansion or the removal of beverage items.
Hence, the topics of **data mining** and **knowledge discovery** are the central themes of this research project on the burger menu dataset.

## Programming languages and tools
Programming languages and tools include various Python and R packages to apply statistical techniques and visualization to answer the guiding research questions to analyze trends, patterns and distributions in the dataset.

## Statistical methods
Statistical methods such as regression, correlation, and feature transformation will be proposed to solve the stated problems and make informed predictions.
